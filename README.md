A simple implementation of my first dApp Using Truffle suite, and the Pet shop Example

Can buy products with Ethereum using Metamask wallet.

Run it as a truffle framework product

`npm install -g truffle`

To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type `truffle version` on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.
